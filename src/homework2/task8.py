# 1 задачка, (In this very first mission you just need to declare two variables a, b
# and set their values to integers 2, 5 respectively.) (2. When done, try to set values for variables in a single line
# (first variables gets first value etc.).) (3. For integers use int type. Rewrite the first variant
# with type annotation.)
# a, b = int(2), int(5)
# 2 задачка
# Let('s introduce two new variables named add, multi. Assign them values equal to the sum and product, '
#     'respectively, of the previously declared variables a, b.)
# add = a + b
# multi = a * b
# print(a, b, add, multi)

# 1. In this mission you need to define a function func, which takes no arguments.
#
# 2. Your function is also not going to do anything! To keep a code (expression) working
# correctly without doing anything you need to use so called placeholders: keyword pass or ... operator.
#
# 3. Note that even if a function returns nothing, it returns the empty value None anyway.
# def func():
#     pass
# def func():
#     return None
